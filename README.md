Yo! As beginners, we follow a specific branching strategy to organize our work effectively. Please read this document carefully before making any changes.

## Branching Strategy

We use the following branching strategy for our development workflow:

- **main**: The `main` branch is the default branch and represents the stable, production-ready code. Do **NOT** directly make changes to this branch.
- **newbie**: The `newbie` branch is specifically created for new team members and beginners to work on. You should create a new branch from `newbie` for each task or feature you are working on.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository (learn git basics first), contribute your part, commit and push changes to the `newbie`. You may create a new branch (use a suitable name such as your own for the branch) if you don't want others to modify your contribution.
